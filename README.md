Showcase your music collection in a way that's streaming platform agnostic + with highlighted selections.
(need a better name)

This repo will hold a collection of node scripts that automate as much as possible of populating a firestore database by
calling all supported service APIs (Tidal, Youtube, Soundcloud and Apple Music <- once I can afford their dev fee). This
firestore is then used by the frontend to diplay my music collection.

### Goals

-   Make my music accessible on any platform: Tidal, Youtube, Soundcloud and Apple Music (Once I can afford their dev fee)
-   Provide a space to showcase and log what music is important to me and why
-   Create a site to demo a potential service.
-   Showcase just how amazing [Soundizz](https://soundiiz.com) is, request access to their API.

### Learning

-   Creating my own API on GCP
-   Preact
-   Slim + Device Responsive UI
-   How to make a Progressive Web App
-   TypeScript (Completed a 4 hour course. [My notes](https://github.com/bmitchinson/LearningTypescript))
-   Bundling (?) (Parcel?)
-   MobX

### Tooling

-   Build a Progressive Web App with TypeScript, Preact, and MobX
-   Host the site using Firebase
-   Host platform specific scripts on GCP
-   Host an API to access Firestore
-   Deployment from GitHub

### Eventually...

-   Integrate a twitter webhook to showcase music selections/highlights alongside personal writing to note random reflections on
    music
-   Let guests sign into the site with Spotify to be able to follow playlists directly from site
